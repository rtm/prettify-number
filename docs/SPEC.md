Write tested code (in any OO language, such as C# or Java) that
accepts a numeric type and returns a truncated, "prettified" string
version.  The prettified version should include one number after
the decimal when the truncated number is not an integer.  It should
prettify numbers greater than 6 digits and support millions,
billions and trillions.
